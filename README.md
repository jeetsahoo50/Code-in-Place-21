This repository contains the final project that I completed in Code in Place '21 class. 

Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ 
As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.
What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?
Data can be found at https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

In my analysis, I have used Python language.
